                        <h2>Treating UTIs</h2>

                        <p>Your doctor or nurse may prescribe antibiotics to treat a UTI.</p>

                        <p>Once you start treatment, the symptoms should start to clear up within 5 days in adults and 2 days
                            in children.</p>

                        <p>It's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.</p>

                        <p>Some people with a severe UTI may be referred to hospital for treatment and tests. You may need to
                            stay for a few days. Hospital treatment is more likely for men and children with a UTI.</p>

                        <h3>Treating recurring UTIs</h3>

                        <p>If your UTI comes back any time after treatment, you'll usually be prescribed a longer course of
                            antibiotics.</p>

                        <p>If you keep getting UTIs and regularly need treatment, your GP may give you a repeat prescription
                            for antibiotics.</p>

                        <h2>Things you can do yourself</h2>

                        <p>Mild UTIs often pass within a few days. To help ease pain while your symptoms clear up:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>take paracetamol – you can give children liquid paracetamol</li>
                            <li>place a hot water bottle on your tummy, back or between your thighs</li>
                            <li>rest and drink plenty of fluids – this helps your body to flush out the bacteria</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It may also help to avoid having sex until you feel better. You can't pass a UTI on to your partner
                            but sex may be uncomfortable.</p>

                        <h2>Causes of UTIs</h2>

                        <p>UTIs are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract. The bacteria enter through
                            the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).</p>

                        <p>Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria are more likely to reach the bladder or
                            kidneys and cause an infection.</p>

                        <p>Causes of UTIs include:</p>

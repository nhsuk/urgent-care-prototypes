                        <ul>
                            <li>avoid activities that cause pain, if possible</li>
                            <li>use an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) on the painful area for up to
                                20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours</li>
                            <li>take paracetamol or ibuprofen</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you have pain after an injury, don't take ibuprofen for the first 48 hours, as it may slow down
                            healing.
